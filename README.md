# boleanAI

With this code you can create a neural network in which you can choose the number of inputs, outputs and hidden nodes. It works on the backpropagation principle.
The program uses the books to read examples and test itself. In book.txt you give the examples which it will learn on and in book1.txt you give it test that it can run and see
if it can solve them. There is always option to manualy enter inputs. When you create a neural network it will check for an existing one with the same number of nodes(input, 
hidden and output), if it finds it will use it but if it dosen't it will create a new neural network which will be saved after closing the program. All in all its a edditable neural
network that can lear itself to solve bolean problems with given examples.
